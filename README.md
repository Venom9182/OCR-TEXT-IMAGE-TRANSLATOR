# Ocr-text-Translator

It’s tough to translate any language on your own in this world with multiple languages.. 
We translate text using google. We can  just copy and paste but we can’t upload a whole folder of multiple pages 
or can translate text from an image.The term “Translator” simply means translating any language to another.
All people on earth are divided by their cultures, and language is a particular feature that makes us so different from each other. 

Unlike other translation application, we provide the option to upload the .txt file as well as image file.
The difference between others and our application is the ability to translate the image and provide the translation in the image file as well as txt file.



Before starting with the translator, let's login the details of the user to get board into the translation account.
